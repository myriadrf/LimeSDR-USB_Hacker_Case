# LimeSDR-USB Hacker Case

![LUHC-01 case](/images/case.jpg)

An acrylic enclosure designed to accommodate the LimeSDR-USB plus either a GPIO Board or LMS8001 Companion.

A complete kit of parts can be bought from [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr).

## Repository contents

The case design is provided in the following formats:

* FreeCAD
* DXF

The case parts are laser cut from the following types of acrylic sheet:

* Base		: 3mm midnight black (frosted opaque)
* Sides & Top	: 3mm glass look (clear with green hue)

Other colours and finishes could be used, and the above were selected for a combination of aesthetic and practical reasons, e.g. frosted finish doesn't pick up finger marks.
